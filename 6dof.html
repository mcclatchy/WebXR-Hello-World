       Z-axis you've got to turn on fly mode. ;) To do that you must override 
       the default camera by adding your own camera element and marking setting
       fly to true in the WASD controls attribute -->

      a material. Now it looks like a tree stump, sorta! 3D materials can get
      very complex very quickly, but here's a good place to start:

      <!-- It's a bird, it's superman, nahh just <a-plane>.
      By default all faces of a piece of geometery are only viewable from one
      direction called the "front." For example if you "walk" into the
      <a-sphere> element you'l notice you don't see the inside, it just
      disappears. You can use material="side:double;" to make things visible
      from both sides. Try moving the attribute from a-plane below to the
      <a-sphere> and walking through it again.
