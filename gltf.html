    <!-- Start your XR scene. You can add a background color to a scene if you
    don't want a textured skybox. You can also take peak under the hood at things
    like the number of frames rendered per second, the number of faces and
    vertices being renderd ad more by adding to your scene 'stats' -->
    <a-scene stats background="color: #4CC3D9">


      <!-- As you start building more complex scenes, with heavier load times
      you'll want to manage how and when different assets are loading, when
      they're held in memory and when they are made available to the render
      For that we have the <a-asset> element.

      <!-- 3D file types are pretty complicated. Common types of .FBX .OBJ and
      .DAE, but a new standard called glTF (Graphics Library Transition Format)
      is immerging with massive industry support.

      Related a bundled bianry version of the format '.glb' is now
      supported by Facebook's 3D Posts and the Open Graph.

      Read more about the format here: https://www.khronos.org/gltf/

      or aframe's gltf loader here:

        <!-- aframe also offers a pretty full featured way to control animations
        there are currently no GUI options for designing animations though, so
        any complex animation will require colaboration between developers and
        animators, as we look at scaling this past the NVL staff.

      This is scan uses an un-lit texture and looks more realistic without the
      addition of lighting, but try uncommenting the lights below to see what
      lighting can do to the scene.
